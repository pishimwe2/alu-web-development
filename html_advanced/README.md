# HTML Advanced Project

This project is part of the ALU Web Development curriculum and focuses on building a fully semantic HTML structure based on a Figma design file â€” with **no CSS or JavaScript**. The goal is to reinforce the importance of clean, accessible, and well-structured markup before applying styles or interactivity.

## Objective

To recreate the **structure** of a modern web page using only HTML, following best practices and closely replicating a designer's layout shared via Figma.

---

## Design Source

- **Figma File:** [Open Design in Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/xyz)  
  *(You must be logged into Figma and duplicate to your drafts to inspect all details)*

- **Fonts Used:**  
  - [Source Sans Pro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Source+Sans+Pro)  
  - [Spin Cycle OT](https://www.myfonts.com/fonts/spincycle/spin-cycle-ot/)

## What Was Built

- A semantic HTML-only page.
- HTML5 structural elements such as:
  - `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<article>`, `<footer>`, and more.
- Placeholder text/images where applicable.
